`censuscoding` is a self-contained tool for determining the Census 
blockgroup for a street address. It is developed by
[Research Improving People's Lives (RIPL)](https://ripl.org).

`censuscoding` requires Python >=3.7 and <3.10.

To install from PyPI using **pip**:  
`pip install censuscoding`

To install a **development version** from the current directory:  
`pip install -e .`

## Running
There is a single command line script included, `censuscoding`.

`censuscoding` supports the following arguments:
* `--input` or `-i` - path to an input CSV file containing columns `record_id`, `zip_code`, and `address`
* `--output` or `-o` - path to output CSV file containing `record_id`, `zip_code`, `blkgrp`
